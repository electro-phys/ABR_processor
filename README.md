# ABR_processor
A processor for ABR data generated by Xiaopeng Liu ABR MATLAB TDT software

## DATA input
***Must use more than one recording***
1. Open processor (it's a mat file)
2. Press button
3. Select the files you want, can only select from one folder at a time so need to do each subject individually if that is the organization scheme
4. Once files are picked for an indiviual reocording, save them under subject name and genotype
5. if file outputs are in both raw and regular, you will need to save a raw file and a regular file csv separately and combine them later in analysis
6. once saved we can upload them to jupyter and easily combine them into a big dataframe

## Sample Analysis Code
Open a sample analysis file to see a standard workflow for ABR analysis to make figures.
Code should be readily applicable and only filenames will need to be updated when merging
